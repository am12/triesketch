# aim
compare similar trie data structures in terms of their prefix search and count times:clear
- marisa-trie package (MarisaTrie)
- naive trie, from class with slight optimizations (NaiveTrie)
- patricia-trie package (PytriciaTrie)
- our implementation of patricia trie (PatriciaTrie)
measured time and memory usage
used increasing k-mer lengths to see growth over query size
