# Trie-Based Phylogenetic Distance Calculation
Group 4a Final Project
Explore two trie-baesd algorithms that enable comparison of genomes to reveal how closely related they are (phylogenetic distance). We benchmarked 6 trie data structures, ultimately settling on PatriciaTries for the algorithms.

How to Run
Run main.py to calculate distance matrices and generate phylogenetic trees for given genomes. Includes a dataset for SARS-CoV-2 Genomes and another test dataset with various animal genomes.

Run mash_script.sh to generate the distance matrices for the SARS-CoV-2 Genomes and animals datasets. Store the files into ./distance_matrices and run mash_and_dashing_tree_construction.py to create the phylogenetic trees.
